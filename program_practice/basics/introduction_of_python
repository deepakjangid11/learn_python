Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming
language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is
known for its simple syntax, readability, and easy learning curve, which
makes it very popular among beginners and professionals.

Key Features of Python :-

Easy to Learn and Read
Python uses simple English-like syntax, so beginners can understand it quickly.

Interpreted Language
Python code runs line by line, so you don’t need to compile it before running.

High-Level Language
You don’t need to manage memory or hardware directly; Python handles many
low-level tasks automatically.

Object-Oriented
Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts like classes and objects.

Portable
Python programs can run on different operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS.

Large Standard Library
Python provides many built-in modules for tasks like math, file handling, and networking.

The most basic Python program is Hello World:-
print("Hello, World!")
