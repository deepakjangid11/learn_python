Variables in Python :

A variable is used to store data in a program.
It acts like a container that holds a value.

  
Example
name = "Deepak"
age = 20

Here:
name and age are variables
"Deepak" and 20 are values stored in them
Python does not require you to declare the type of a variable; it automatically detects it.

  
Data Types in Python :

A data type defines the type of value stored in a variable.

Example Program:
name = "Deepak"   # string
age = 20          # integer
height = 5.7      # float
student = True    # boolean
print(name, age, height, student)
